**Probability sampling**: Participants are selected on a statistically random basis.
- Simple random sampling: Completely random selection.
- Stratified random sampling: Random selection from predefined subgroups (strata) that share a common trait. It's used for heterogeneous population.
- Cluster sampling: Selection from naturally occurring and mutually exclusive clusters. It's used for homogeneous population.

**Non-probability sampling**:
- Purposive sampling: Selection from a well defined group (e.g. customers of a shop).
- Convenience sampling: Selection based on availability or accessibility (e.g. next 10 items from the assembly line).
- Snowball sampling: Selection based on referral from other participants. It's used when it's difficult to identify or access a population.
