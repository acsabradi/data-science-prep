Supervised learning is a machine learning approach in which an algorithm learns from **labeled training data to make predictions or classify new, unseen data**. It involves the use of input data and corresponding output labels, allowing the algorithm to learn **patterns and relationships**. The goal is to **generalize the learned patterns** and accurately predict outputs for new input data based on the learned patterns.
