Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach wherein an algorithm **uncovers patterns and structures within unlabeled data, operating without explicit guidance or predetermined output labels**. Its objective is to reveal **hidden relationships, patterns, and clusters** present in the data. Unlike supervised learning, the algorithm autonomously explores the data to identify inherent structures and draw inferences, proving valuable for exploratory data analysis and the discovery of novel insights.
